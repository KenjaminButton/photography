    - POST /api/posts - Database insertion works
    - GET /api/posts - Retrieval works
- Decisions:
  - Using Cloudinary for image storage
  - Form includes fields: title, content, image, status, and publish date

### [2025-03-21 01:53] Homepage Redesign Decision
- Context: Discussing homepage structure and content presentation
- Discussion: 
  - Identified redundancy in separate gallery/blog routes
  - Questioned need for navigation to separate content page
  - Decided to show content directly on homepage
- Decisions:
  - Remove gallery/blog split
  - Display posts directly on homepage in grid/masonry layout
  - Each post to show image with title
  - Click to expand for full content/story
- Rationale:
  - Better UX with immediate content access
  - Eliminates unnecessary navigation
  - Common pattern in photography portfolios
  - Infrastructure already supports this (Turso DB, Cloudinary, API routes)
- Next Steps: Implement homepage redesign with direct content display
